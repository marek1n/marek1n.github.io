  I'm currently finishing the MSc programme in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. 
  Previously, I studied mathematical logic and received MA (Hons) in Philosophy from the University of Glasgow.


  I'm broadly interested in finding out about basic neural mechanisms through computational modelling and neuroimaging techniques. 
  I also like to think about theoretical issues in neuroscience, such as incorporating 4EA approaches (affordance theory, enaction, interoception and allostatic control etc.) into current paradigms.


  I work as student researcher at the Computation and Cognition Lab, HMU Potsdam; previously I was also at Science of Intelligence (Technische Universität Berlin) and Neural Dynamics of Visual Cognition (Freie Universität Berlin).
  Before that, I spent a year in industry as data analyst and engineer.

  #         I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            I created, ran and analyzed an online pilot study, including a novel large-scale two-tone (Mooney) image dataset 
            in preparation for a laminar fMRI study on the interaction of feedforward and feedback processing in visual recognition.
